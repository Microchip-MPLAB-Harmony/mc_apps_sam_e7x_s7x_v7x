    "content": "This section briefly explains the FOC control algorithm, software design and implementation. Field Oriented Control is the technique used to achieve the decoupled control of torque and flux. This is done by transforming the stator current quantities (phase currents) from stationary reference frame to torque and flux producing currents components in rotating reference frame using mathematical transformations. The Field Oriented Control is done as follows: . | Measure the motor phase currents. | Transform them into the two phase system (a, b) using the Clarke transformation. | Calculate the rotor position angle. | Transform stator currents into the d,q-coordinate system using the Park transformation. | The stator current torque (iq) and flux (id) producing components are controlled separately by the controllers. | The output stator voltage space vector is transformed back from the d,q-coordinate system into the two phase system fixed with the stator by the Inverse Park transformation. | Using the space vector modulation, the three-phase output voltage is generated. | . Sliding Mode Observer (SMO) : . Sliding Mode Observer is used to estimate the rotor position and thus speed. The electrical rotor position and speed is calculated using the Sliding Mode Observer. The main disadvantage of SMO Observer is its inability to estimate the rotor angle at lower rotor speeds because of very low value of back EMF. Therefore, the FOC algorithm also integrates the ramp-up profile for motor start. The reference speed is incremented linearly using a open loop phase voltage control until the required minimum reference speed for the SMO observer is reached. The Sliding Mode Observer ( SMO ) is based on the principle of sliding mode control. It generates a sliding motion on the error between the plant output and the output of the observer such it produces a set of states that are precisely drives the estimated output to the actual output of the plant. The sliding mode observer consists of a model based current observer followed by a back EMF Observer. The observed back EMF is filtered and then used to extract the position information from it. The following figure shows a typical Sliding Mode Observer: . The current and back EMF observer is modeled in discrete time by following equations: . Current Observer: . Back EMF Observer: . The following block diagram shows the software realization of the FOC algorithm. ",

    "content": "The following figure shows the various state machines of the the motor control software. In the software, the PMSM speed control task is realized by a state machine as shown in the previous figure. The following sections briefly describes the various states in the PMSM speed control task: . | Initialize: | . In this state, following tasks are performed: Initialization and configuration of NVIC, AFEC, PWM motor control peripherals for generation of periodic ADC triggers and ADC conversion interrupt Current Offset measurement and calibration Initialize PI controller parameters for speed and current control loops . | Start: | . In this state, the motor control state variables are reset and periodic ADC conversion interrupt is enabled. Control waits for the switch press. | Run: | . In this state, the motor starts spinning. The following flow chart and the timing diagram shows the tasks performed in run state: . In run state, two threads are executed- Main task thread and ADC Interrupt task thread. The current control and speed control is carried out in the ADC interrupt task thread. The main task thread monitors the external switches and maintains the state machine. Therefore, the ADC interrupt cycle indicates the current and speed control frequency. As pointed out earlier, the SMO is unable to estimate the rotor position information at the start-up phase when the speed is very low. This necessitates the motor control algorithm to integrate an open-loop control mechanism to linearly ramp the motor speed to the required minimum speed before switching over to closed loop control. Therefore, the motor control state can further be classified into three sub-states - Field Alignment, Open-loop Control and Close-loop Control. Field Alignment: In this mode, a limited value of DC current is applied to the U phase of PMSM motor in order to align the rotor magnetic field with the U-phase of the motor. The time for which DC current has to be applied to achieve the field alignment depends on the time constant of the PMSM motor drive. Open Loop Control: In this mode, the speed of the PMSM motor is gradually ramped up using an open loop control. The speed is ramped up linearly to a minimum value required for the sensor-less SMO observer to estimate the speed of the PMSM motor with required accuracy. Close Loop Control: In this mode, the speed can be regulated using closed loop SMO based sensor-less FOC algorithm. | Stop: In this state, the PWM channels are disabled thereby stopping the motor. The periodic ADC trigger and conversion interrupt is disabled. | . ",

    "content": "The Power Factor Correction is a technique of increasing the power factor of the input AC power supply, thereby providing following advantages: . | Low line harmonics. | Reduced input current. | Reduced kVA requirement. | Improved line efficiency, and improved electromagnetic compatibility. | . The Power Factor Correction techniques can be classified as - Passive and Active. The Passive Power Factor Correction uses passive components, while the active Power Factor Correction Technique uses power electronic switches to carry out Power Factor Correction. Following figure shows the various Power Factor Correction techniques classification: . This project uses Boost topology for Power Factor Correction. A boost converter is placed between the rectifier and output inverter stage to synchronize input AC current to the input AC voltage. For details, refer to application note AN1106. The block diagram of a typical boost converter topology based Power Factor Correction is shown below. Block Diagram: . The power factor correction is implemented in following steps: . | Measure the rectifier stage rectified AC voltage and rectified AC current, and output inverter stage DC bus voltage via high speed ADC channels. | Regulate the DC bus voltage using the Voltage Error Compensator. | Determine the reference input for Current Error Compensator based on the output of Voltage Error Compensator and Voltage Feed-Forward Compensator. | Track the rectified reference AC current using a Current Error Compensator. | . Current Error Compensator: . The inner loop in the control block forms the current loop. The input to the current loop is the reference current signal IACREF and the actual inductor current IAC. The current error compensator is designed to produce a control output such that the inductor current IAC follows the reference current IACREF. The current loop should run at a much faster rate when compared to the voltage loop. The bandwidth of the current compensator should be higher for correctly tracking the semi-sinusoidal waveform at twice the input frequency. The current controller GI produces a duty cycle value after appropriate scaling to drive the gate of the boost converter MOSFET. Voltage Error Compensator: . The outer loop in the control block forms the voltage loop. The input to the voltage loop is the reference DC voltage VDCREF and the actual sensed output DC voltage VDC. The voltage error compensator is designed to produce a control output such that the DC bus voltage VDC remains constant at the reference value VDCREF regardless of variations in the load current IO and the supply voltage VAC. The voltage controller GV produces a control signal, which determines the reference current IACREF for the inner current loop. The output voltage is controlled by the voltage error compensator. When the input voltage increases, the product of VAC and VPI increases, and thereby increasing the programming signal. When this signal is divided by the square of the average voltage signal, it results in the current reference signal being reduced proportionally. The outcome is that the current is reduced proportionally to the increase in voltage, thereby keeping the input power constant. This ensures that the reference control output IACREF from the voltage compensator is maximum such that the rated output power is delivered at minimum input voltage. Voltage Feed-Forward Compensator: . If the voltage decreases, the product (VAC · VPI), which determines IACREF, also proportionally decreases. However, to maintain a constant output power at reduced input voltage, the term IACREF should proportionally increase. The purpose of having an input voltage feed-forward, is to maintain the output power constant as determined by the load regardless of variations in the input line voltage. This compensator implemented digitally by calculating the average value of the input line voltage, squaring this average value and using the result as a divider for the input reference current, which is fed to the current error compensator. FOC with PLL estimator : . This estimator uses PLL structure to estimate the rotor position and thus speed. Its operating principle is based on the fact that the d-component of the Back Electromotive Force (BEMF) must be equal to zero at a steady state functioning mode. It can not estimate the rotor angle at lower rotor speeds because of very low back EMF. So, open loop startup is used till required minimum speed is achieved. The following block diagram shows the software realization of the FOC algorithm. ",
