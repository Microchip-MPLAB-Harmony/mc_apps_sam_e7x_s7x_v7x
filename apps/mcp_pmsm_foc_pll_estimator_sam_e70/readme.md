# PMSM FOC using PLL Estimator

This example application shows how to control the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) with PLL Estimator based Field Oriented Control (FOC) on a SAME70 Micro-controller. 

## Description

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is controlled using Field Oriented Control (FOC). Rotor position and speed is determined using PLL estimator technique. Motor start/stop operation is controlled by the switch and motor speed can be changed by the on-board potentiometer. Waveforms and variables can be monitored runtime using X2CScope. 

Key features enabled in this project are:

- Dual shunt current measurement
- Speed control loop
- Field weakening


## MHC Project Configurations

![MHC Project Graph](images/project_graph.jpg)

- **AFEC Peripheral**: 

    The AFEC is used to measure analog quantities. Four channels are used to measure the Phase Current U, the Phase Current V, the DC Bus Voltage and the Potentiometer. Conversion is triggered at the PWM (zero match + offset of the switch delay) 
- **PWM Peripheral**: 

    This peripheral is used to generated three phase synchronous PWM waveforms. Fault functionality is also enabled to switch off the output waveforms asynchronously.
- **X2CScope**: 

    This component adds X2C scope protocol code. This uses UART to communicate to the host PC. X2CScope allows user to monitor variables runtime.
- **UART Peripheral**: 

    The UART is used for X2CScope communication to observe graphs and variable values in run time
